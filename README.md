## üöÄ How to Run the Project

1. Make sure you have **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed.
2. Start the project by running:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

3. Once started, the application will be available at:
http://localhost:8082
(you can change the port in docker-compose.yml)

4. Add to the .env file and configure the database connection:
```
DATABASE_URL="mysql://symfony:symfony@db:3306/symfony?serverVersion=8.0"
```

## üõ† What to Do If Something Breaks

If the project doesn‚Äôt start automatically:
1.	Enter the PHP container:
```
docker exec -it <php-container-name> bash
```
2. Manually install dependencies:
```
composer install
```
3. Run the database migrations:
```
php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
```
